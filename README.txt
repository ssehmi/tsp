TO RUN
npm instal && npm run dev

Navigate to the localhost url webpack tells you:
http://localhost:9000

You should see a graph with all the cities plotted on it.
When you click the button below it outputs the "shortest path" to be taken.
It aslo runs a simulation connecting the poins in order of cities to travel to.
The alogrithm is using closes city from the one your on then works out the next and so on.
I comleted up to here within 4 hours, I spent extra time on the Graph data structure, I wanted my alogrithm to run of the graph data structure but was unable to get this working.


The Graph direcotry is incomplete it is a Graph Data Structure
The console log in the browser shows that all tours have been put into the graph data Structure
Ideally I wanted to run algorigthms against the graph data structure. 
I looked into Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, I couldn't implement this.
My alogrithm is not the best path but more of an approximatation.
